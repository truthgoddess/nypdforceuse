# NYPD FORCE USE D3 DATA DISPLAY

_if it is easy to see, it is easy to contemplate_

This application organizes and displays the NYPD use of force data that can be found at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/use-of-force-data.page

It uses the FullStack Academy's boilermaker as a starting point. You can few the original readme by viewing the FS_README.md file. The boilerplate uses Express/Sequelize and React/Redux.

This app further utilizes D3 and a Postgres DB to help display the data.

More later.
